		<p>
		One fine afternoon in October 2003, Mohammad Saleem Rana walked into my office and told me that he wanted to share an idea with me.</p> 
		<p>
		He wanted to form an association of independent convenience store retailers. The association would act as their bargaining agent to negotiate beneficial deals with vendors and service providers to make the stores competitive in the market. The association would also provide them a platform for planning and carrying out diversified activities for working together, safeguarding and promoting their interests.
		</p>

		<p>
		His idea was appealing. It had potential. We decided to form the association. At the very outset we decided that the association would be a non-profit organization with an open membership policy irrespective of the member’s religion, race, color, sex, ethnic background, or language.
		</p>

		<p>
		I called Khalid Bajwa and told him about the association. He promised his wholehearted support and cooperation. I also called Tahir Khan, who jumped at the idea. After that Mohammad Saleem Rana called other storeowners and so did I. All of them liked the idea, and assured us of their total support. In a short time we were able to form a group of storeowners who liked our idea, and extended their support and cooperation. Their response was encouraging and promising. 
		</p>

		<p>
		We held our first organizational meeting at a local hotel. The number of storeowners who showed up was very reassuring. It inspired us to hold more meetings. In each meeting the attendance kept on growing. Very soon we were able to form a group of storeowners large enough to launch the association. 
		</p>          

		<p>
		In the General Body Meeting held on January 21, 2004, attended by a large number of storeowners, it was unanimously decided to incorporate the association, form and elect the members of the Executive Committee. Mohammad Saleem Rana, Sajid  Bajwa and Tahir Khan were elected as the members of the first Executive Committee, now called Board of Directors.

		<p>ACSR was born.</p>

		<p>
		ACSR was incorporated under the Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act. Its Charter (800299406) was issued on January 26, 2004. Bylaws were approved and adopted on March 31, 2004 in the General Body Meeting.
		</p>  

		<p>
		ACSR is different from other trade groups, business organizations and associations. It is a non-profit organization that does not run any commercial operations and does not operate for profit. Unlike other associations, it is neither a religious nor religious-sectarian organization. Its membership is not restricted, but is open to all. 
		</p>

		<p>
		In 2007 we extended our membership to owners of non-franchised businesses also. The term “Business” includes professionals.
		</p>

		<p>
		ACSR has deals with major and small vendors. ACSR also has deals with service providers. We call them Preferred Vendors of the Association. Please check the details of these deals and the benefits by visiting Preferred Vendor’s pages.
		</p>

		<p>
		ACSR keeps its members informed about the deals. It tells them exactly what benefits they would receive in return for compliance with the terms and conditions of the deals, and actually pays them these benefits.
		</p>

		<p>
		The members’ benefits under the deals with Preferred vendors comprise of:
		</p>

		<ul>
		<li>On-Invoice Benefits</li>
		<li>Off-Invoice Benefits</li>
		<li>Professional services at discounted rates</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		On-invoice benefits are passed on directly to the members without any deductions. Off-Invoice benefits are paid in accordance with the association’s disbursement policy laid out in its Bylaws. The policy authorizes the association to retain a small portion of these benefits, to cover the operating expenses of the association. For details please check the Bylaws.
		</p>

		<p>
		The member’s benefits are disbursed at the Annual General Body Meeting usually held in March or April every year. Besides being a festive event, it has informative programs, a sumptuous dinner and prizes to be won by the members through raffle drawings.
