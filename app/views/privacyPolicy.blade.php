The Association is obliged to keep secure financial and confidential information about a member that may be available to it. The Association shall not sell or share financial or confidential information to any company, organization or agency unless required by law to do so;</p>

<p>During the course of doing business the Association would collect and use various types of information to service members, save them time and money, and better respond to their needs. This information would be provided i) by the members on their membership application, and at other times as and when needed; ii) by vendors with whom members do business; iii) and from outside sources such as public records;</p>

<p>Access to financial and confidential information would be secured and limited. Excepting office bearers, who would need access to this information solely for the purpose of managing the Association, general members, shall not have access to financial or confidential information about other members. The office bearers would be bound by a code of ethics that would require confidential treatment of such information, and would be subject to disciplinary action for violating the code;</p>

<p>The employees of the Association would have limited access to this information only when they would need it to provide members with products and services or to maintain the records. They would be bound by a code of ethics that would require confidential treatment of such information, and would be subject to disciplinary action if they failed to follow the code.</p>

<p>The Association would share general information about its members with companies with whom its members do business to assist the Association in receiving account statements of member's transactions, service requests or requirements, and receiving product and service information;</p>

<p>The Association might also share general information about its members with companies with whom its members do business, or prospective companies that want to do business with its members solely for the purpose of securing better deals, terms and conditions of doing business;</p>

<p>This general information might also be shared with these companies to enable them to send information directly to members about their line of products, new products, deals, and other services that they could provide to members saving them time and money;</p>

<p>Should a member elect not to receive product or service information by direct mail, telephone or e-mail the member shall contact the company directly requesting it to be removed from their mailing list, and shall inform the Association. In case of non-compliance by the company the Association shall take adequate steps to insure honoring of member's request;</p>

<p>Keeping members information accurate and up to date is very important. Should a member feel that the information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current the member should immediately contact the office of the Association for necessary action. The Association will promptly update or correct any erroneous information. The member may bring a grievance in case the Association fails to do the needful in accordance with the bylaws of the association.</p>
